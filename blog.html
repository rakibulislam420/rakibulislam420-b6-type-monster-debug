                    <strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between local storage and
                    session storage?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ans:</strong> localStorage- localStorage is a property that
                    allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web
                    browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the
                    browser will persist even after the browser window is closed. <br />
                    <br />
                    SessionStorage- SessionStorage stores object data only for a
                    session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage will be
                    deleted when the browser is closed.

                    <strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between Global scope and
                    block scope?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ans:</strong>Global scope- Global scope is the context where
                    everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope
                    includes all variables, objects, and references that are not
                    contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Block scope is an area within if, switch conditions, or for and
                    while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets},
                    it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to
                    declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables
                    exist only within the corresponding block.

                <h3><strong>Q:</strong>How does the event loop work?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ans:</strong>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor
                    the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty,
                    the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will
                    push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an
                    iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                <h3><strong>Q:</strong> How many types of Undefined we can get?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ans:</strong>A variable that has not been assigned a value
                    is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined
                    if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned
                    value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
                    Also, a functin returns undefined whewn parameter declared but no
                    auguments passing.
